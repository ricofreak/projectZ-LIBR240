                        <h1>The Minds of a Library Technolgist</h1>
                        <p>The library technologist must be action oriented. Working in technology makes the action mind-set very interesting to me. The relentless pace of change the world can move at, especially in technology, can be numbing. We have to constantly stay up-to-date on technology and decide what is needed, or what is just a passing fad. Using the action mind-set is important. Technologists must quickly decide if something is going to benefit the library and be worth the money spent. Recently this has been things like 3D printers, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and the latest eReaders. If we wait too long we can risk becoming irrelevant and loose library users. Libraries are dealing with limited budgets and can’t have it all. Action comes from strategic planning and systematic decision making. We are successfully doing this by planning regular technology meetings and then implementing the solutions we come up with during these meetings.</p>
                          <p>Technologists must analytical. I am reminded of a time I spend planning, developing, and creating a new website for a public library I was working at. During that process I truly learned the importance of thorough analysis and good organization. The entire staff knew that the old website was ineffective, poorly designed, and ready to be replaced. The very first step I had to take was to figure why the old site was so bad. This required a thorough decomposition of every component and aspect of the old website. This helped me figure out why people, both staff and patrons, thought this was such a horrible site. The next step in the process involved analyzing other library websites, especially ones that were typically looked at favorably. This helped me figure out what aspects of a library website people liked. Although I had experience in web design I had never built a library website before. If I had not gone through the analytical process of examining both poorly constructed sites and good ones I would have never had known how to proceed. Armed with this knowledge I was able to create a new, and much more functional, website for the library.</p>
                          <p>The library technologist must be worldly. Thinking worldly is an ever important skill to have in libraries today, especially for leaders, directors, and managers. I began to look at this mindset from the viewpoint of library collection development. This is an aspect of librarianship where I think it is vital to understand the worldly viewpoint. Even when libraries are regionally located the advent of technology and the internet have given us access to global resources, even though those resources may be virtual. Now, more so than ever, we need to provide our patrons with both local resources and worldly resources. Where to we find the right balance of material for the library? We need act both locally and globally, in other words worldly. This can be a hard task for librarians, or directors, when decide what materials to put in the library, both physical and digital. The right balance is crucial in being a well rounded public library. I emphasize public libraries because I currently work at a public library. The public will always demand resources of every kind. Collection development plans need to try to accommodate everyone.  We as librarians and collection developers must change our view of the world, much like Anjin-san in Shogun, and not get to caught up in regional viewpoints or global viewpoints. To me this is the essence of thinking with the global mindset.  </p>
                          <p>I work in a very unique cultural setting in my library in southwestern Colorado. We are located, and surrounded by, Southern Ute Indian reservation land. This makes for what is typically called a tri-ethnic rural community. This cross culture dynamic reminded me a lot of the example Gosling & Mintzberg use with the Shell corporation. While Shell incorporated the British and Dutch cultures here we are often mixing rural white, hispanic, and Native American cultures. Much like Shell we are ‘rooted’ in these three cultures. While we are located on an reservation we are still a public library open to all peoples and not funded by the tribe. We must maintain an atmosphere and policy that is open and welcoming to all. At the same time we must be very careful not neglect or offend traditions and culture of any of the three very distinct and different groups living in the area and patronizing our library. Patrons and the general public can often be highly critical. Adopting a worldly mindset is very important for us, most importantly for the director who sets library policy and controls our public face. The mindset must trickle down to every member of the library staff. The worldly mindset, and knowledge of all cultures, is important as we try to appease all three cultures while simultaneously be welcoming to anyone who wishes to visit our public library. </p>
                          <p>Technologists should be reflective. In the modern, fast-paced, hectic work world it can be easy to go through a day without taking a few moments to step back and reflect. Oftentimes we are to busy working towards deadlines and attending meetings to really take a moment and think. Experiences only become real after a period of reflection on the happenings of a given day. Often times during my day I get bogged down with a ton of different tasks, especially working with all the technology at the library. This gives me a very little time to step back and reflect. Perhaps if I took that time, at the same point everyday, I could get a better understanding of the bigger picture.</p>
